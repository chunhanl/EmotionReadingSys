# EmtionReadingSystem

## Motivation
A speaker must have the ability to read the feeling of the audience. In order to provide the speaker an immediate feedback from the audience's reaction, we propose an emotion-reading system, which is based on the analysis of the facial emotion of the audience, to let the speaker decide on what to say in the next couple of minutes. 

## Introduction
The emotion-reading system detects the faces appear in the given input, and analyzes the emotion of it with nural networks. Based on the results, it then calculates a score that reflects the response of the people.



## Short Demo

By the emotion score, it may serve as an indicator of the response of the audience
